# SMKC Bio
A simple app to input personal information and dialing a number (with a pleasant surprise *wink*). Only presets/built-in library are in use, most are purely my code. This app works both in landscape and portrait.

#### What can you learn from this app?
  * Basic Kotlin, and XML
  * Values (Colors, styles, and strings)
  * Layouting (Relative layout, and linear layout)
  * Forms (Edittext's variants, spinner, and buttons)
  * Bundle (A way to pass data between activity)
  * Intent
